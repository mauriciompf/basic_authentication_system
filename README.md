# Basic Authentication System

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to practice web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. Through this project, I aim to deepen my knowledge of documentation, client-side and server-side validation, PHP language, database management, MySQL with PHP, and the combination of front-end and back-end development.

## This Project

The project, titled **Basic Authentication System**, is a web application that allows users to create and manage their accounts. The system provides the following key features:

- **Account Creation**: Users can create their own accounts and log in to access their data.
- **Data Viewing**: Users can view their personal information in a clear table format.
- **Account Management**: Users can create additional accounts, as long as the email addresses are not already in the database.
- **Login and Logout**: Users must log in to access the site and log out when leaving their account.
- **Registration**: If users are not yet registered, there is an option to create a new account. Conversely, a login option is provided for returning users.

This project aims to provide a simple and intuitive user experience, focusing on essential authentication features while ensuring secure data management and proper handling of user accounts.

## Note

Since this is a personal practice project, _maybe_ I  will list the functionalities I have already implemented, am currently working on, or plan to implement in the future. Keep in mind that these are not all the functionalities I initially envisioned for this project.

## Functionalities

- When a user enters the site, they should be presented with a **sign-in box** that contains input fields for **email and password**.
- There are two buttons in the sign-in box:
    - **Enter account**: Allows the user to sign in using their provided email and password.
    - **Register new account**: Takes the user to a new account registration form.
- The forms should incorporate **accessibility features** such as:
    - **Labels**: Descriptive labels for input fields to help users understand what information to provide.
    - **ARIA attributes**: Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) attributes to improve the experience for users with disabilities.
- If the user clicks the **register new account** button, the login box is replaced by a registration form.
